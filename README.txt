This is the respository for Zatch, an IRC bot I made. Also it needs the Pircbot api to work.

Developers:
Sapein/Chanku: The original developer, he started Zatch around Janurary 31st, 2014. He's worked on Zatch
somewhat actively. He's also, for all intents and purposes, the 'father' of Zatch. 

Wuufu/Jarada: A second developer joined the team during Rewrite2 he is somewhat the father of 'modern Zatch' as
he contributed a lot of the code as well. 


Branches:

- Voting: Where the voting is, if you want to work on Zatch's Voting Ability then you want this one (NOT DEVELOPED)

- BetterLogging: where I began work on better logging (DONE)

- Master: This is the master branch, if I deem something stable I'll bring it here

- WHR-Zatch: A rewrite of Zatch for the WHR

- Rewrite: My Rewrite of Zatch to organize things. This WILL be merged into Master when I'm done. (DONE)

- Rewrite2: A second rewrite of Zatch, designed for better optimization and modulization. (CURRENT DEVELOPMENT)
